<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Group A</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12371375, 12590611</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework</strong>
<strong>did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the widely known and popular Huggingface package <code>transformers</code> as third-party package in our project. We used functionality for loading pretrained models and tokenizers from the package to do text classification in our project. The package also provided us with a lot of documentation and examples which helped us to quickly get started with our project. Additionally, we used the datasets package from Huggingface to load the dataset we used for training our model. The big variety of models enabled us to use a lightweight model that was able to run on our local machines without the need for a GPU. </p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used pip for managing our dependencies and continuously filled out the <code>requirements.txt</code>, <code>requirements_dev.txt</code> and <code>requirements_test.txt</code> files with the necessary packages.</p>
<p>It's also a possibility to auto-generate the list of dependencies using <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>To reproduce our exact development environment, one would have to run the following commands:</p>
<p><code>bash
pip install -e .</code></p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the <code>src</code>, <code>reports</code>, <code>data</code> and <code>tests</code> folder. We have removed the <code>docs</code> folder and the <code>notebooks</code> folder because we did not use any documentation or notebooks in our project. We also added a <code>cloud</code> folder, which contains yaml files with cloudbuild configurations and vertex AI configurations. The most relevant deviation from the template is that we have added a <code>logs</code> folder that contains trained model checkpoints and evaluation results.</p>
<p>```</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong>
<strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em>
<em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used <code>ruff</code> for linting. Additionally we did typing and we documented our code consistently. These concepts are important in larger projects because they help to maintain code quality and readability. They are also helpful to better understand the code and to avoid bugs. </p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We implemented 4 automatic tests in our code which we divided in two categories: unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests are testing the data loading and preprocessing and the the model training. The integration tests are testing wether the API of the backend (app.py) is working properly and as intended. The tests are run automatically using continuous integration on GitHub whenever we create a pull request or commit code to the main branch. The tests are also run locally using pytest.
Furthermore we a load test script (locustfile.py) which can simulate a load test of multiple users accessing the API at the same time. This script is not run automatically but can be run locally by any group member. </p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total code coverage of our code is 37% since some parts of our code are not covered by tests. We are far from 100% coverage of our code and even if we were then we would not trust it to be error free. The reason for this is that code coverage only measures how much of the code is executed during the tests, but it does not measure wether the code is error free or not. So it's possible to have a high code coverage, but still have bugs in the code. </p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We made use of both branches and pull requests in our project. In particular, we created for each task an issue on GitHub which contains a check list of smaller parts of the task. The issues were then assigned to a group member who would then create a branch and link the issue to the branch. When the task was completed, the group member would create a pull request to merge the branch into the main branch. The continuous integration would then run tests. The pull request should only be merged if all tests passed. This way we wanted to ensure that the main branch was always in a working state. We could have improved this workflow further by requiring that another group member reviewed the pull request before merging it. Moreover we could have protected the main branch such that it could not be merged into without a reviewed pull request or without successfully passing the continuous integration tests.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used DVC for tracking our data (<code>processed.dvc</code>) and model checkpoints (<code>run1.dvc</code>). Some of our containerized scripts (train.py, data.py and evaluate.py) use dvc pull and push in the corresponding .yaml files to automatically pull the data and model checkpoints from the DVC remote storage. This way we can ensure that the data and model checkpoints are always in sync with the code. </p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong>
<strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong>
<strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em>
<em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em>
<em>here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have organized our continuous integration into 2 separate files: one for doing unit testing and one for running linting. For the unit testing we used pytest and for the linting we used ruff. We also made use of caching to speed up the continuous integration and we use multiple operating systems (Linux, MacOS and Windows).</p>
<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most relevant instance here is our train.py since it contains a lot of hyperparameters. We used a config file for reproducibility (see next section). We have configured the training script such that it can be run with a command line interface using the following command (10 epochs):</p>
<p><code>bash
train --epochs 10</code></p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We created one config file containing the hyperparameters for our training script. The config file is used to load the hyperparameters using Hydra. </p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="wandb" src="figures/ROC.png" />
<img alt="wandb2" src="figures/wandb.png" />
We were tracking the ROC curve.</p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our project we developed 6 docker images: one for data preprocessing, one for training, one for evaluation, two for the deployment backends (app.dockerfile and bento.dockerfile) and one for the frontend. Note that our actual application uses the app.dockerfile for deployment, but we also created a bento.dockerfile for testing purposes. For the latter we have a very slim image which even contains an onnx model.</p>
<p>For instance, have a look at our at our BentoML App which is lightweight (small container). Note that this is only the backend.
To pull the docker images, you can use the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/mlops-hatespeech/hs-images/bento-app:latest</code></p>
<p>To run the docker image on a Mac, you can use the following command:</p>
<p><code>bash
docker run --rm \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/mlops-hatespeech/hs-images/bento-app:latest</code> </p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We primarily used logging and print statements to debug our code. </p>
<h2>Working in the cloud</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 17</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We made use of the following GCP services:
- <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Store data, reports, model weights, user requests
- <strong>Artifact Registry</strong>: Store all docker images
- <strong>Cloud Build</strong>: Build docker images and trigger workflows
- <strong>Vertex AI</strong>: Train and deploy models
- <strong>Cloud Run</strong>: Deploy the API
- <strong>Secret Manager</strong>: Store secrets like the WANDB_API_KEY</p>
<h3>Question 18</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs</strong>
<strong>you used?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the</em>
<em>using a custom container: ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:
We used custom Vertex AI Jobs which internally rely on Google Cloud Compute Engine. For this we implemented containerized jobs, pulled from the artifact registry. Note that we also abused those Vertex AI Jobs to run our data preprocessing and evaluation scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Machine Type: n1-highmem-2
We specified a service-account eligible for Vertex AI and Artifact Registry access.</p>
<h3>Question 19</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.</strong>
<strong>You can take inspiration from <a href="figures/bucket.png">this figure</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="bucket" src="figures/GCPbucket.png" />
<img alt="bucket2" src="figures/bucket2.png" /></p>
<h3>Question 20</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1-2 images of your GCP artifact registry, such that we can see the different docker images that you have</strong>
<strong>stored. You can take inspiration from <a href="figures/registry.png">this figure</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="registry" src="figures/registry.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Question 21</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1-2 images of your GCP cloud build history, so we can see the history of the images that have been build in</strong>
<strong>your project. You can take inspiration from <a href="figures/build.png">this figure</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="build" src="figures/cloudbuild.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Question 22</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to train your model in the cloud using either the Engine or Vertex AI? If yes, explain how you did</strong>
<strong>it. If not, describe why.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We managed to train our model in the cloud using the Engine. We did this by ... . The reason we choose the Engine</em>
<em>was because ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our model training can be executed hierarchically, meaning that we use the same train.dockerfile for the cloud as for local execution. Since the training requires a WANDB_API_KEY environment variable, the vertex AI job a two-stage process with one stage including a placeholder in the vertex config file and the other stage starting a temporary alpine container injecting the secret from the GCP secret manager. The second stage then runs the training script with the WANDB_API_KEY environment variable set.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<h3>Question 23</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If</strong>
<strong>not, explain how you would do it.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...</em>
<em>to the API to make it more ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have two apps for demonstration purposes: One uses FastAPI and the other uses BentoML. The FastAPI app is implemented in <code>app.py</code> and the BentoML app is implemented in <code>bento_app.py</code>. The FastAPI app is a simple API that takes a text input and returns a prediction of whether the text is hateful or not. We also added a frontend for the FastAPI app using Streamlit, which allows users to interact with the API in a more user-friendly way. Both apps are containerized using Docker and can be deployed in the cloud using Cloud Run. The FastAPI app is also able to log the predictions to the Cloud Bucket relevant for data drift detection.</p>
<h3>Question 24</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and</strong>
<strong>preferably how you invoke your deployed service?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which</em>
<em>worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call</em>
<em><code>curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"&lt;weburl&gt;</code></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We deployed our app locally using Docker and in the cloud using Cloud Run. The local deployment can be done by running the following command (assuming you have the docker image pulled with the command shown above): </p>
<p><code>bash
docker run --rm \
  --platform=linux/amd64 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/mlops-hatespeech/hs-images/bento-app:latest</code> </p>
<p>With the above command, the app starts locally. </p>
<p>Try the backend API with the following link:
https://bento-app-178847025464.europe-west1.run.app/</p>
<p>Note that it might a while since our deployment is request based and a Kaltstart is required.</p>
<h3>Question 25</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for</strong>
<strong>the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...</em>
<em>before the service crashed.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We performed unit testing of our API using pytest and load testing using Locust. The unit tests can be run using the command <code>pytest</code>. </p>
<p>The results of load testing showed that the API does not crash under high load, but the average response time slightly increases when the number of users increases.
<img alt="locust" src="figures/loadtest.png" /></p>
<h3>Question 26</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to implement monitoring of your deployed model? If yes, explain how it works. If not, explain how</strong>
<strong>monitoring would help the longevity of your application.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did not manage to implement monitoring. We would like to have monitoring implemented such that over time we could</em>
<em>measure ... and ... that would inform us about this ... behaviour of our application.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We implemented prometheus monitoring of our deployed model. </p>
<h2>Overall discussion of project</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we would like you to think about the general structure of your project.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 27</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many credits did you end up using during the project and what service was most expensive? In general what do</strong>
<strong>you think about working in the cloud?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Group member 1 used ..., Group member 2 used ..., in total ... credits was spend during development. The service</em>
<em>costing the most was ... due to ... . Working in the cloud was ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One group member forgot to stop a virtual machine, which led to higher costs.
The Google Cloud Trial does not include GPU resources, so we couldn't use one of the services. </p>
<h3>Question 28</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement anything extra in your project that is not covered by other questions? Maybe you implemented</strong>
<strong>a frontend for your API, use extra version control features, a drift detection service, a kubernetes cluster etc.</strong>
<strong>If yes, explain what you did and why.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 0-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We implemented a frontend for our API. We did this because we wanted to show the user ... . The frontend was</em>
<em>implemented using ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We implemented a frontend for our app that allows users to interact with the API in a more user-friendly way. The frontend is implemented using Streamlit and is able to send requests to the API and display the results. We also added a drift detection service that monitors the requests including input and prediction of the API and logs them to the Cloud Bucket. This allows us to detect if the data is drifting over time. The drift detection looks at the embeddings, keywords and class frequencies of the requests and compares them to the training data. </p>
